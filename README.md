This project was my final degree project. 

It contains the database, back-end and front-end of the web service.
The API is developed in node js and the front end in CSS, JS and HTML.

The service is a ice cream recipe claculator also with the capability of storing recipes and ingredients. The characteristics of the ingredients are also calculeted by the program.
